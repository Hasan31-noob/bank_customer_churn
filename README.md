Project     : Bank Customer Churn Prediction  

This project is a simple Streamlit web application that I built to analyze 
and predict customer churn in a bank using a Machine Learning model 
(Random Forest).

The application includes interactive components and visualizations 
to help users explore the data and understand the prediction results.
